# Crewmate Management Web App

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

- Setup and use supabase-js to manage a database
- Perform various API requests that will change your web app according to CRUD

## Required Features

1. A create form allows users to add new crewmates
   - Users can name the crewmate
   - Users can set the crewmate's attributes by clicking on one of several values
2. The site displays a summary page of all the user's added crewmates
3. A previously created crewmate can be updated from the crewmate list
4. A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list
5. Each crewmate has a direct, unique link to an info page about them

## Screenshots

A simple version of the web app with all the required features implemented:

- Home Page
- Create a New Crewmate
- Empty Crewmate Gallery
- Populated Crewmate Gallery
- Crewmate Details
- Update A Crewmate

## Stretch Features

- A crewmate can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attributes, such as a Dungeons and Dragons class or a development team role (project manager, product owner, etc.)
- The site displays summary statistics about a user's crew on their crew page, such as the percent of members with a certain attribute
- The site displays a custom "success" metric about a user's crew which changes the look of the crewmate list, such as a pirate crew's predicted success at commandeering a new galley
